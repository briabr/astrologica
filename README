# <Astrologica>

## Description

Our users want an application that would help them view events happening around them such as celestial movements. Our application will help the the user narrow down the astrological events to show the ones that are closest to them. The application will account for user's current whereabouts to display accurate information relevant to them. We learned a lot from this project particularly: writting functions, using APIs data, CSS, html and most importantly working with branches in GitHub.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

The user can navigate to the website and use menu and navigation bars along with the search buttons to obtain the information relevant to them. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
